## About Me

My name is Ishita Sarraf. I am studying at Computer Science and Statistics at Grinnell College, IA. I am originally from Kolkata, India. I have just completed my sophomore year. I am interested in doing research in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I am interested in looking at the intersection of technology with various different fields. In the summer of 2022, I had worked as a Backend Developer for New Emerging World of Journalism in Mumbai, India where I developed a pipeline used to extract information from various websites and automated it to work every 5 minutes. I am conducting research in Information Quality lab with Dr. Jodi Schneider and PhD mentor Yuanxi Fu at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for the Summer of 2023. I am working on developing, documenting, and testing reusable pipelines for acquiring and processing full-text content of scholarly publications by text and data mining. I am interested in going to graduate school to further learn about the various ways to conduct Computer Science and make an impact on society using my research. 


## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Jodi Schneider from the Information Science School at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Jodi Schneider is Associate Professor of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where she directs the Information Quality Lab. She studies the science of science through the lens of arguments, evidence, and persuasion. Her long-term research agenda analyzes controversies applying science to public policy; how knowledge brokers influence citizens; and whether controversies are sustained by citizensâ€™ disparate interpretations of scientific evidence and its quality. She holds affiliate appointments in the Beckman Institute, Health Care Engineering Systems Center, European Union Center, Informatics, Center for Health Informatics, and Cline Center for Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois and the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Illinois Chicago School of Medicine. Her work has been funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the European Commission, IMLS, NIH, Science Foundation Ireland, and an NSF CAREER award.

## About My Project

My project involves developing, documenting, and testing reusable pipelines for acquiring and processing full-text content of scholarly publications by text and data mining. It will establish the capabilities and limitations of APIs and natural language processing libraries for use in future Information Quality Lab project that use scholarly publications as data. I will develop, document, and test pipelines to (1) acquite full-text data from Crossref's text and data mining API; (2) process the data into desired formats to assist my PhD mentor Yuanxi Fu on a project that requires full-text retrieval and processing; (3) and extract other information of interst to lab members.
